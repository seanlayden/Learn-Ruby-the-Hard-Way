# This line prints out a string.

# This line prints out a string.
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}."
# This line prints out a string.
puts "And everywhere that Mary went..."
# This line prints out a string ten times in a row.
puts "." * 10 # <-- What did that do?

# The following lines define a number of variables, from end1 to end12. It then stores a short string in each variable, in this case, just a single character.
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"

# Watch that print vs. puts on this line. What's it do?

# Print vs. Puts:
# Print does not create a new line following the output to the console. Puts outputs, and then goes to new line.
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
